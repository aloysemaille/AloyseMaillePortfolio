<div>   
    I am part of the AFOSR Sub-team. My work as primarly focused on Qubits and resonators fabrication process design and implementation, as well as research on the impact of 2D-materials on phonon decoherence in quantum devices. I am trained and certified for CNF cleanroom access where I primarly perform my work. 

    Proficient in advanced fabrication techniques including optical and electron-beam photolithography processes (spinning, baking, HDMS oven primer, ABM and SÃœSS aligner, JEOL 6300), dry transfer of 2D materials, and reactive ion etching (RIE). I am also proficient in using AJA sputtering systems and the AJA ATC 1800-HY tool for sputtering, ion milling, and controlled oxidation. I can perform measurements with the Everbeing DC Probe Station and the KLA P7 profilometer, as well as any optical microscope and associated imaging/analysis software for nanoscale device inspection and alignment. Other trainings I acquired are micro-bonding, hysical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) and dry transfer.

    I was awarded the Summer 2025 Research Award, funded by Boeing. I also got the wonderful opportunity to be featured on Cornell Engineering medias.

    Since joining the lab in September 2023, I gained a lot of autonomy on the projects and now have almost complete freedom on the design of the fabrication process design of the qubits, on which I work closely with Joyce Christiansen-Salameh - my mentor since I joined, in Chicago since last winter - and Simon Shi - who joined the project this summer and to whom I got to share my previous experience with optical photolithography and etching processes -, both graduate students working towards PhD.
