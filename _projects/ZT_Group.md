FI am part of the experimental side of the subgroup working on implementing 2D-materials on quantum devices. As part of the research, I am trained to use:
- wire bonder, 
- PPMS (Physical properties measurement system),
- microscope with associated online programs,
and I am also trained to access the cleanroom - in which our microscope and other devices are currently located. Other processes I am trained on and familiar with are dry transfer, photolithography and reactive ion etching.
