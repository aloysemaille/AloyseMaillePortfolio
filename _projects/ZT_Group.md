    FI am part of the experimental side of the subgroup working on implementing 2D-materials on quantum devices. As part of the research, I am trained to use:
    - wire bonder, 
    - PPMS (Physical properties measurement system),
    - microscope with associated online programs,
    and I am also trained to access the cleanroom - in which our microscope and other devices are currently located. Other processes I am trained on and familiar with are dry transfer, photolithography and reactive ion etching.
