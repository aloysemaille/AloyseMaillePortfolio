  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="about-description">
    My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a French and Canadian citizen but lived in Paris, where I was born, my entire life before coming to the US to study engineering at Cornell University. I absolutely love to discover new places and meet new people, so I travel a lot. I always do a lot of sport, I am currently part of Cornell's Women Varsity Polo Team and Cornell Taekwondo Club. I also enjoy reading and doing art in my free time. My current career goals are to expand my knowledge of the space and quantum fields and gain experience in both. I am particularly interested in research and development, design and project management.
