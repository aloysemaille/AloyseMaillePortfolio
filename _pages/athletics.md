  <p> I am a student-athlete and I am part of the Women's varsity D1 polo team! My background is in evnting (dressage, showjumping and cross-country), and the Cornell Polo Team gave me the opportunity to learn a new sport and compete as a varsity athlete. This past summer, I participater in several official outdoor polo tournaments from the 0-goal level to the 4-goal level.

  <p> During my first semester at Cornell I discovered taekwondo. I went from white belt to currently red belt and won several sparring medals in intercollegiate tournaments. Taekwondo is not my primary sport, however I believe it adds a lot to my athletic training for polo, helping me gain more flexibility, be stronger and have more balance.
